      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2);

      // age = 200;

      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2);
      // name = "wesley";
      // console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do soemthing like this:
      // team[3] = "Lux";
      // Both players and team arrays are modified of we update one of them, both array[3] will equal 'Lux'!!!!!! does not work the same as numbers strings and booleans!!!! WRANING!!! IF you update and array it will always reference back!!!

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They boh point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); //slice takes a copy of the original array
      // by dooing this if you update they copy array, the reference array will not get modified/it will stay the same
      team2[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(team2);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players); // you can do it like this also

      // ur use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]; // or like this
      team4[3] = "heeeee haww";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[2] = "Goofy";
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, Let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99; //forces initial object to take the same value via reference

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ... spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.number = 90;

      // Things to note -  this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesboss.developer",
        },
      };

      const dev = { ...wes };

      //if you want more than 1 level deep copies without referencing you need a clone deep function (can be found online)

      // poor man's deep clone: (performance issues)
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      dev2.social.twitter = "@coolman";
